- Split navigation into tab + modal stacks; avoided 3 duplicate stacks on deep links.
- Added route-scoped stores so switching tabs preserves scroll position.
- Instrumented cold starts with Perf Monitor; biggest win came from deferring font loading.
- Shipped OTA patch to clean up lingering navigation listeners.
