## Pattern
Use a tab navigator for primary domains, each owning its own stack. Overlay a global modal stack for flows like checkout or profile edit so tab stacks keep their history intact.

## Why it works
Tabs retain state (scroll, filters) while modals stay isolated and dismissible without resetting tabs. Deep links map to either tab roots or specific modal routes, avoiding nested stacks that bloat memory.

## Implementation notes
- Keep a single navigation container; expose a typed navigator helper so screens stay inferable.
- Register modals in a dedicated navigator with `presentation: 'modal'` to reuse transitions across platforms.
- Push analytics events from a nav listener that emits focus + blur per route to avoid double logging on re-mounts.

## Edge cases
Handle cold-start deep links by hydrating auth and tab state before rendering modals. Add a guard so an already-open modal replaces rather than stacking duplicates.

## Testing
Use Detox to assert tab state persistence after opening/closing modals. Snapshot test the navigation tree to prevent regressions when adding routes.
