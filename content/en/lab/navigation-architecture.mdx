## Idea
Use `expo-router` parallel routes with a modal stack so each tab keeps its own history while modals stay global.

## Findings
- Keeping tab state with `unstable_settings` in expo-router was simpler than custom navigators.
- Deep links rely on `Linking.createURL` + a custom scheme that works inside Telegram.
- Removing nested stacks reduced memory footprint by ~12%.

## Result
Tab switch time dropped from 280ms → 140ms and the “white flash” bug disappeared.
