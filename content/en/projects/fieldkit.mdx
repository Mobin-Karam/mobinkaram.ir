# Problem
Support teams sent field updates via WhatsApp; SLA breaches were invisible.

# Architecture
- Next.js App Router + server actions for ticket ops
- Supabase for auth + realtime presence
- Mapbox for technician routing
- Edge Functions for operator webhooks

# Highlights
- Technician location events every 30s; server actions used for atomic upserts.
- Dynamic form schema per failure type, pulled from CMS so operators require zero training.
- RTL/LTR aware map controls with offline fallback tiles.

# Learning
Edge caching on the ticket list kept TTFB at 180ms without sacrificing freshness.
