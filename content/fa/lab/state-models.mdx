## Context
Installation forms had 200 fields and struggled on low-end Android devices.

## Experiment
- Variant A: Zustand with precise selectors
- Variant B: React Hook Form + `useFieldArray`
- Tools: React Profiler + Web Vitals

## Results
- Variant A rendered ~6 times per change; Variant B ~14.
- A used less memory but made deeply nested data awkward.
- Final hybrid: React Hook Form for validation, Zustand for cross-form shared state.

## Takeaway
Separating validation from display kept speed while taming complexity.
