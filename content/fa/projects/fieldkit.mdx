## Problem
Field researchers needed durable stations that could log climate data in remote areas, buffer measurements offline, and sync reliably when gateways came online. Existing commercial options were expensive and locked down.

## Architecture
Solar-powered STM32-based nodes collect sensor readings and push packets over LoRaWAN to regional gateways. A NestJS ingest API validates payloads and writes to TimescaleDB partitions. A Next.js dashboard overlays Grafana panels for real-time visualization and anomaly alerts.

## Tech decisions
LoRaWAN was chosen for low-power, long-range hops; STM32 keeps BOM costs low. TimescaleDB provides hypertables for fast time-range queries. OTA updates for firmware ride over the same gateway channel, signed and versioned to prevent downgrade attacks.

## Challenges
Intermittent connectivity meant we needed a double-buffer scheme on the MCU plus idempotent ingest endpoints. Clock drift on sensors initially skewed aggregates; we added GNSS pulse syncing during boot and periodic NTP corrections at the gateway.

## Security considerations
All firmware updates are signed; gateways validate signatures before flashing. Device-to-cloud traffic is AES-encrypted with keys rotated during provisioning. Dashboard access relies on role-based spaces so research teams can segregate deployments.

## Deployment
Gateways run on balenaOS with containers updated via balenaCloud. Cloud stack is containerized on AWS ECS with scheduled compression jobs for aged partitions. Monitoring hooks export device health to Prometheus and feed PagerDuty alerts.

## Lessons learned
Designing for observability at the edge (battery, RSSI, uptime) prevented most field trips. Keeping the data model narrow—timestamp, location, sensor type, value—made the ingest path resilient under varying firmware versions.

## Next
Scale to 200+ stations, add ML-based anomaly detection for early wildfire signals, and expose a public data slice with rate limits for citizen scientists.
